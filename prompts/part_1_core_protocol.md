**1. Eth R\&D Protocol Call(s) (e.g., All Core Devs Consensus/Execution, ACDC/ACDE)**

  * **Content:**
      * Provide summaries for any core developer calls (ACDE, ACDC, etc.) that had notes published or were discussed within the past 7 days.
      * **Primarily source these summaries from posts by Andrew B Coathup (`@abcoathup`) on Ethereum Magicians (`https://ethereum-magicians.org/u/abcoathup/activity`).** Check this source for any new call notes posted within the 7-day window.
      * For each call summarized, **you MUST include a direct link to the specific Ethereum Magicians post** (e.g., `https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/acdc-call-123-date/xxxxx`).
      * The structure and level of detail for each call's summary should emulate how "Week in Ethereum News" typically presents these (e.g., highlighting key discussion points, decisions, and action items, often with sub-bullets for different topics discussed in the call).
      * **Crucially, verify the date of the call itself and any critical details (like EIPs discussed or major decisions) against official sources (e.g., meeting agendas/notes on `https://github.com/ethereum/pm`) even when using summaries from Ethereum Magicians. Do NOT report calls or summaries of calls that occurred outside the specified 7-day window. If no relevant calls were summarized by `@abcoathup` or had official notes published this week, state that clearly or omit this section.**
