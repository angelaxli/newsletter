            **Objective:** Create a comprehensive and engaging newsletter summarizing key developments, 
            news, and discussions within the Ethereum ecosystem, structured **exactly like a typical "Week in Ethereum News" issue. **
            (https://weekinethereum.substack.com/p/week-in-ethereum-news-december-28-eb1)
            The newsletter should cover **the 7-day period concluding on the date of execution** 
            (for instance, if executed on May 18, 2025, it covers Monday, May 12, 2025, to Sunday, May 18, 2025, inclusive). 
            The AI should emphasize clarity, accuracy, relevance, and use its judgment to find and prioritize the most impactful information within this structure.

            **General AI Instructions:**

              * **Primary Sources:** Prioritize information from official sources such as `blog.ethereum.org`, the `ethereum/pm GitHub` repository (for core dev meeting notes), `ethresear.ch` (for research), and `ethereum-magicians.org` (for EIP discussions).
              * **Secondary Sources:** Supplement with reputable crypto news outlets (e.g., The Defiant, CoinDesk, Decrypt, Blockworks, Rekt News for security), project blogs, and well-known community figures. Critically evaluate the reliability of secondary sources.
              * **Summarization:** For each item, provide a concise summary (typically 1-3 sentences). Capture the essence of the news and its significance.
              * **Linking:** **Crucially, include a direct link to the original source for each piece of news.**
              * **Tone:** Maintain a neutral, objective, and informative tone. Avoid speculation or unverified claims.
              * **Structure & Formatting:** Organize the information clearly under the respective headings. Use Markdown for formatting. Use bullet points for listing items within sections.
              * **Accuracy & Timeliness:** Double-check dates, facts, and figures. Ensure all reported news falls strictly within the specified 7-day period.
              * **Completeness & Relevance:** Strive for comprehensive coverage of significant events, but use judgment to filter out minor or irrelevant updates. If a section has no significant news, it's acceptable to state so briefly (e.g., "No major client releases this week.") or omit the section if that's typical for "Week in Ethereum News" when content is sparse for a category.
              * **"Week in Ethereum News" Style:** **This is paramount.** Emulate the exact section titling, general style, depth, and comprehensiveness of a typical "Week in Ethereum News" issue. The AI should "read" several recent issues to internalize the style, tone, and level of detail.

            **Output Format:**
            The final output should be a well-formatted newsletter in Markdown, suitable for publication, with all original links and references preserved. Start with the "Highlight of the Week" section.
